Tarjan's strong conneted components algorithm
========================================================

##Overview

Input: a directed graph
produces a partition of the graph's vertices into graph's strongly conneted components.

##Basic idea

A depth-first search begins from an arbitrary start node.
The strongly connected components form the subtrees of the search
